"Prisoners of the Void" Introduction: "Prisoners of the Void" is the first chapter in the Void Saga, introducing the players to life aboard the ancient prison ship, 
the Void. This chapter serves as an introduction to the game mechanics, establishing the harsh, oppressive environment that the PCs must navigate. The chapter 
culminates in an asteroid strike that leaves the ship in dire straits, setting the stage for the next chapter, "Escape from the Void."

Scene 1: Morning Roll Call Narrative: The day begins with the grating blare of klaxons echoing through the metal corridors. The ship's AI, with its cold, mechanical 
voice, announces the start of another day. The PCs are herded out of their cramped cells by guards, their every movement monitored by the Void's aging surveillance 
systems. In the mess hall, they receive their meager rations—a tasteless, nutrient-rich paste—and are assigned their work details for the day. The atmosphere is 
tense; some prisoners have been here for years, others just days, but all are united by their shared misery.

Skill Checks:

Recon (DC 6): A PC who succeeds on this check notices a brewing conflict among the prisoners or a guard taking an unusual interest in them. This information can be 
used to avoid trouble or manipulate the situation to their advantage. Social Interaction: PCs may attempt to interact with other prisoners or guards. A Social (DC 6) 
check could allow them to gain a minor ally or avoid unwanted attention. Scene 2: The Work Detail Narrative: The PCs are escorted to various parts of the ship for 
their work detail. The Void is a massive vessel, and its ancient systems are prone to malfunction. Today, the PCs are tasked with repairing old machinery deep in the 
bowels of the ship, clearing blockages in the waste disposal system, or mining asteroids in a nearby belt—each task more dangerous and degrading than the last. The 
work is exhausting, and the constant supervision by guards leaves little room for error or slacking.

Skill Checks:

Mechanic (DC 8): Required to repair faulty equipment. A successful check results in the repair being completed without incident. Failure could mean the equipment 
malfunctions, possibly causing injury or drawing the ire of the guards. Athletics (DC 8): Needed for hauling heavy materials or clearing blockages. Success allows 
the PC to complete the task without incident, while failure results in fatigue or minor injury (1d6 damage). Electronics (DC 8): Used to interface with the ship's 
outdated computer systems. A successful check might reveal hidden information about the ship or its systems, while failure could trigger an alarm or cause a system 
failure. Random Event: During the work detail, there’s a chance that something goes wrong—an equipment malfunction, a fight among prisoners, or a guard crackdown. 
Roll 1d6; on a 1-2, a random event occurs:

Equipment Malfunction: A piece of machinery breaks down, requiring immediate repair. Another Mechanic (DC 8) check is needed to fix it, or it could cause a serious 
accident. Prisoner Fight: Tensions boil over, and a fight breaks out. PCs must make a Dexterity (DC 6) check to avoid getting caught in the brawl or suffer 1d6 
damage. Guard Crackdown: The guards decide to assert their authority, demanding all prisoners return to their cells early. Any resistance will result in a 
confrontation. Scene 3: The Riot Narrative: The monotony and tension of the Void reach a breaking point. A dispute between prisoners in the mess hall erupts into 
violence, quickly spiraling into a full-blown riot. The guards move in with stun batons and tear gas, while the PCs are caught in the middle. They must decide 
whether to fight, flee, or find a way to use the chaos to their advantage.

Skill Checks:

Melee (DC 6) or Gun Combat (DC 8): If the PCs choose to engage in the fight, they can use these skills to defend themselves or take down guards. Success means they 
hold their own, while failure might result in injury or capture. Stealth (DC 8): If the PCs try to slip away unnoticed, a successful check allows them to evade the 
guards and find a safer location. Failure could mean they are spotted and pursued. Leadership (DC 8): A PC with strong leadership skills can attempt to rally other 
prisoners, turning the tide of the riot or securing an escape route. Success means they gain temporary allies, while failure could backfire, leading to more chaos. 
Consequences: Depending on their actions, the PCs might gain a temporary ally among the prisoners, earn the ire of the guards, or find themselves in solitary 
confinement. If they manage to escape the riot unscathed, they might overhear guards discussing the increasing instability of the Void's systems.

Scene 4: Lockdown Narrative: The riot is brutally suppressed, and the entire ship is placed on lockdown. The PCs are confined to their cells, the lights dimming to a 
dull red as the AI enforces a curfew. The ship feels more oppressive than ever, with the distant sounds of guards patrolling and the groans of the ship's ancient 
systems reverberating through the walls. The PCs have time to reflect on their situation, plan their next move, or simply try to survive the psychological toll of 
solitary confinement.

Skill Checks:

Survival (DC 6): PCs can use this check to mentally prepare themselves for the harsh conditions of solitary confinement. Success allows them to maintain their 
resolve, while failure might result in temporary penalties to social or physical tasks. Tactics (DC 8): The PCs can use this time to plan their next move, whether 
it’s a bid for freedom, revenge on a rival prisoner, or gathering information. Success might give them an edge in future encounters, while failure could mean missed 
opportunities. Scene 5: The Asteroid Strike Narrative: Just as the lockdown is lifted and the PCs are released from their cells, the Void is struck by an unexpected 
asteroid shower. The ship shudders violently, alarms blare, and the lights flicker. Hull breaches occur in several sections, and the PCs must quickly react to avoid 
immediate danger. The situation is chaotic, with debris flying and parts of the ship exposed to the vacuum of space.

Skill Checks:

Dexterity (DC 8): Each PC must make this check to avoid being hit by falling debris or sucked toward a breach in the hull. Failure results in 1d6 damage or a 
temporary injury, such as a sprained ankle or concussion. Mechanic (DC 8) or Electronics (DC 8): The PCs can attempt to stabilize their section of the ship by 
sealing breaches, rerouting power, or patching into the ship's emergency systems. Success helps mitigate the immediate danger, while failure could worsen the 
situation or result in more severe consequences later. Cliffhanger Ending: The adventure ends as the PCs are left in the damaged ship, uncertain of what will come 
next. The Void is severely compromised, and the PCs must prepare for the challenges ahead as they face the aftermath of the asteroid strike.
